# MJB-TMF-Universal-Template

# How to use:
1. Press Code (green button) -> Download ZIP to get a copy of the template.
2. Extract the folder and place it in your mission-making folder, typically Documents/Arma3 - Other Profiles/"your username"/mpmissions
3. Rename the .VR-main affix with that of the terrain you desire.
4. Access the file in 3DEN and delete whatever assets you don't need (Note: Deleted assets are a hassle to get back, so plan ahead!).

# Modifying the Arsenal:
To make changes to the arsenal, use the arsenal.sqf file in the loadouts folder and add/remove desired equipment.
Scroll to the bottom to view what roles have which equipment blocks, preferably with an IDE to make searching through it less of a headache.

# Modifying starting loadouts:
Access the player_loadout.hpp file in the loadouts folder and search for your role based off the names in the mission editor.
